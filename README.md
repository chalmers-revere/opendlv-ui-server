# opendlv-ui-server

The opendlv-ui-server is a basic HTTP/Websocket implementation which is the backend for default OpenDLV interfaces. It can either be used as-is to distribute HTTP content from a folder and stream OD4 messages of a pre-defined CID through Websockets, or it can be used for creating more system integrated applications with a web interface.
